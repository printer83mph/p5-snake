# p5-snake
Version of the classic game snake in p5

## Features and stuff
I have attempted to make this version of snake as modular as possible. This means that most everything is a constructor/class - including the grids!

## Controls
Use WASD for player 1, arrow keys for player 2
Screen wrapping is a thing!
Currently you can kill yourself by moving backwards
